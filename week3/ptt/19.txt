作者hazih (Justin X 煞氣騰)看板studyabroad標題[選校] 分享德國CS相關英語授課碩班課程時間Wed Jul 18 19:04:19 2018
剛好看到有人分享
德國國際碩士學程CS相關課程整理

有列出學費，雅思成績，deadline。還有課程網站等。

因為不是所有課程都在DaaD查得到。
或是可以搜尋我的文章也有列一些學校。
可以減少找學校資料的時間。

作者maxo (來   笑一個:)看板studyabroad標題[情報] PhD position 德國(LMU Munich)藥學系時間Tue Jul 24 19:44:17 2018
PhD position:
Characterization of endo-lysosomal ion channels by patch clamp
@ LMU Munich, Germany

More than 70 different ion channels and transporters are harbored in
membranes of intracellular compartments such as endosomes and lysosomes.
Malfunctioning of these channels has been implicated in human diseases such
as lysosomal storage disorders, neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases, as
well as in the progression of certain infectious diseases. As a consequence,
these channels have engendered very high interest as future drug targets. Our
group, is one of a few groups worldwide, which has established the manual
patch clamp technique for endo-lysosomes.

We are currently looking for recent graduates (Pharmacy, Master of Science in
biology, chemistry, pharmaceutical sciences or similar) who are interested in
learning and applying this technique with a particular focus on the
endolysosomal ion channels, i.e. TRPML cation channels (mucolipins) and
two-pore channels (TPCs). We are looking for candidates with high intrinsic
motivation and a drive for scientific innovation and discovery. The candidate
would ideally have experience in molecular biological techniques and would
have strong interest in patch-clamp electrophysiology. The LMU is one of the
top ranked German universities.; our department is located on the LMU’s high
tech campus (Munich Grosshadern) with close proximity to several Max-Planck
institutes and other research institutions.

If you believe you fit this description then please send a brief letter of
motivation, a short CV highlighting your academic and research accomplishments
to [email<U+00A0>protected]
